# IrpTransmogrifier-GUI

*Note: This is very early, experimental stuff. It is currently **not usable for non-programmers**.
However, feedback of all sorts is welcome. And, of course, contributions.*

As the name suggests, this project consists of an experimental GUI for
[IrpTransmogrifier](https://github.com/bengtmartensson/IrpTransmogrifier).
It is intended as a testbench to try some (for me) new things, like Java Swing's internal frames.

In the future, this work might be merged into [IrScrutinizer](https://github.com/bengtmartensson/harctoolboxbundle).
